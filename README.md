# ComposeBasics
Trying out compose features

To build the project the Arctic Fox version of the Android Studio is required.

Mainly this project is a mess, that consists of the compose functions. There is no architecture here or some useful app. Just a bunch of the code. The main reason for this project - is for me to poke the compose around and figure out how to work with it.

Current code is a result of next courses/articles/etc.:
